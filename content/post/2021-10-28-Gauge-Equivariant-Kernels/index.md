# Abstract

Gaussian processes are machine learning models capable of learning unknown functions in a way that represents uncertainty, thereby facilitating construction of optimal decision-making systems.  Motivated by a desire to deploy Gaussian processes in novel areas of science, a rapidly-growing line of research has focused on constructively extending these models to handle non-Euclidean domains, including Riemannian manifolds, such as spheres and tori. We propose techniques that generalize this class to model vector fields on Riemannian manifolds, which are important in a number of application areas in the physical sciences.  To do so, we present a general recipe for constructing gauge equivariant kernels, which induce Gaussian vector fields, i.e. vector-valued Gaussian processes coherent with geometry, from scalar-valued Riemannian kernels. We extend standard Gaussian process training methods, such as variational inference, to this setting. This enables vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds to be trained using standard methods and makes them accessible to machine learning practitioners.

# Vector-field Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds

Gaussian Processes are useful tools for non-parametrically modelling distributions over function, $f: X \to Y$, for example $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, the space of 1-D functions, or $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, a vector field over the 2-D plane. These function spaces can be modelled with well known kernels such as squared exponential and MatÃ©rn class of kernels.

It is not necessary however for $X$ or $Y$ to be some Euclidean space. Previous works has focused on constructing kernels for working with Riemannian manfolds. Two particular cases have been investigated, the case of scalar functions on a manifold ($f:M \to \mathbb{R}$), and functions from the real line onto a manifold ($\mathbb{R} \to M$). 

In this paper we are interested in constructing Guassian processes over _tangential vector fields_ over manifolds. These are functions $M \to TM$, maps from the manifold into the _tangent space_ of the manifold.

The tangent space of a single point on a manifold is in intuitively all the directions one can move on the manifold from that point. The tangent space of a _single point_ will always be isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^d$ for a $d$ dimensional manifold.

Crucially though, there is no canonical basis on these tangent spaces. Taking the union of the tangent spaces of all the points on a manifold gives the manifold's tangent space.
