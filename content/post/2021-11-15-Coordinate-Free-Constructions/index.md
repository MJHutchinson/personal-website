## What are manifolds? Why do we care about them? basic examples 

- Simple intuitive intro to what a manifold is, links to more technical definitions (another post, later in the post, textbooks?)
- Description of the settings in which non-Euclidean geometry is useful, idea that this is the natural extension / formalisation of common notions on Euclidean space (probably a good theme to ref continually is the simplification in Euclidean space)

## A more technical intro to what a manifold is

- is it worth discussing the metric lightly?

## An introduction to the more abstract formulation of tangent fields (i.e. without a basis), the hairy ball theorem 

- tangent bundle is union of tangent spaces, nice pics of this

## Introduction to a choice of gauge / frame, transformations

## A description of what happens with transporting things around on manifolds, and why this matters

## Examples: Coordinate-independent CNNs, Gauge-independent kernels

- Probably better to keep the discussion vector field focused, and note the extension to other cases?

## Post-script - equivariance?
